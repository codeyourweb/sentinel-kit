## Where is the project heading?

This project is in its early stage of developpement. Read the README file as it clearly detail where this project is going. To summarize it in few lines:

* By now, everything is under construction in order to get a functional and logical stack for detection and response

* longer term vision is not clearly defined. This project will evolve based on the initial feedbacks
